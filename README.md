# Introduction to R

## Overview
R is one of the leading programming languages in the data science community. It was designed to efficiently process computations across large datasets. The R ecosystem provides APIs for the entire analytical process: loading, wrangling, analyzing, and visualizing data. Because it is an open-source project, new functionality is constantly being developed and shared.

This introduction is brief and designed for individuals with functional programming experience. For a more descriptive set of exercises, please see the [INFO-201 learning modules](https://github.com/info-201).
